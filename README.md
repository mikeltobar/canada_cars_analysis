## Introduction

This is an analysis of a dataset containing many of the cars present in Canada and their pollution. It was first published by the Canadian Federal Government, but the one chosen for this notebook has been taken from Kaggle. You can find the files:

* In [Open Data Canada](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/98f1a129-f628-4ce4-b24d-6f16bf24dd64) 
* In [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/debajyotipodder/co2-emission-by-vehicles)

The license of the Kaggle dataset is "Open Database", so it can be shared, modified and used freely. This is a project in progress that will try to add some machine learning features to the initial analysis, maybe adding more data.

## Authors

This work has been made by Mikel √Ålvarez Rua and Mikel Tobar del Barrio.
